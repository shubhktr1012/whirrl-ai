# Project: Whirrl.ai
# Description: This file contains coding standards and guidelines for the Whirrl.ai project to ensure smooth development, debugging, and scaling.
# Note: Adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle to avoid redundant code and ensure that past mistakes are not repeated.

## 1️⃣ General Development Guidelines
- **Follow a Structured Debugging Approach:** Always check logs, backend status, and frontend errors systematically before assuming an issue.
- **Ensure Backend is Running Before Testing Frontend:** Many issues have arisen due to the backend not being started.
- **Log API Responses Properly:** Always log `response.json()` and not just `response` to ensure the correct data format is being returned.
- **Keep Code Organized & Versioned:** Use Git effectively to track changes and revert if necessary.
- **Follow the DRY Principle:** Write modular, reusable code to minimize redundancy, and ensure that both developers and the AI do not repeat previously made mistakes.

## 2️⃣ Project Structure & Code Organization
- **Frontend:** TypeScript + React + TailwindCSS
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express + TypeScript
- **Media Processing:** FFmpeg + Whisper AI
- **File Handling:** Multer for uploads, proper directory structuring (`uploads/`, `gifs/`, `audio/`)
- **Job Queues:** BullMQ
- **Security:** Content Security Policy (CSP) and CORS handling
- **State Management:** React `useState` hooks for UI updates
- **Requests Handling:** Fetch API with error handling & logging

## 3️⃣ API & Backend Communication
- **Always use `POST` requests for video uploads.**
- **Expected API Response:** `{ message: 'GIFs generated successfully!', gifUrls: [...] }`
- **GIF Serving Path:** Ensure `/gifs/` is correctly exposed in `server.ts`
- **Set proper headers for CORS handling** (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin` for `http://localhost:5173`)
- **Debugging Upload Issues:**
  - Check backend logs (`console.log`) for errors
  - Use `curl` commands to test manual uploads
  - Ensure `ALLOWED_FORMATS` matches expected MIME types

## 4️⃣ Common Mistakes & Their Fixes

### 🔹 CORS Issues
- Ensure backend allows requests from `http://localhost:5173`.
- Explicitly define `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` and methods in `cors()` middleware.
- Always restart the backend after making changes to CORS settings.

### 🔹 File Format & MIME Type Issues
- `Invalid file format` errors even when the file is correct → Log `req.file.mimetype` and compare it to `ALLOWED_FORMATS`.
- Ensure correct MIME types are included in the backend's validation.

### 🔹 Serving Static Files Correctly (GIFs, Images, etc.)
- Always verify if `express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'gifs'))` is correctly serving files.
- Confirm the expected file paths using `console.log(path.join(__dirname, 'gifs'))`.
- Ensure frontend fetches from `http://localhost:5000/gifs/filename.gif`, not `http://localhost:5000/gifs/http://localhost:5000/gifs/filename.gif`.

### 🔹 API Not Fetching Data Properly
- Check if `fetch()` URL matches exactly with the backend API endpoint.
- Verify that API methods (`GET`, `POST`) are correctly implemented in both frontend and backend.
- If `Failed to fetch` occurs, check if the backend is running and not crashing.

### 🔹 Frontend Not Updating After Backend Response
- Ensure state updates are handled correctly (e.g., `setGifUrls(response.gifUrls)`).
- Always verify that `.map()` is iterating over an array and not `undefined`.

### 🔹 Content Security Policy (CSP) Blocks
- Update `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy">` in `index.html` to allow necessary external sources.
- Ensure `img-src` includes `http://localhost:5000` to allow GIFs to be displayed.

## 5️⃣ Frontend UI/UX Standards
- **File Upload:** Show progress bar updates accurately.
- **Preview Handling:** Only enable preview button when GIFs are ready.
- **GIF Gallery:**
  - Dynamically update with received GIF URLs.
  - Include hover/download animations.
  - Ensure `/gifs/` path is correct when displaying images.
- **Timeout Handling:** Set fetch timeout (e.g., 5 mins for uploads, 10 sec for GIF verification).

## 6️⃣ Efficiency & Best Practices for Future Projects
- **Use a Standardized Project Structure:** Keep `frontend/` and `backend/` folders clearly separated.
- **Set Up Git Properly:** Ensure `.gitignore` excludes `node_modules/`, `.env`, and generated files (e.g., `gifs/` and `uploads/`).
- **Implement Proper Logging:** Always add `console.log()` statements to debug API requests and responses effectively.
- **Automate Cleanup Tasks:** Ensure temporary files (SRT, WAV, TXT) are deleted after use to avoid unnecessary storage usage.
- **Have a Template for New Projects:** Maintain a boilerplate with reusable configurations, including CORS settings, error handling, and API structuring.
