# 🐛 Whirrl.ai - Bugs & Fixes  

## 🚨 Current Issues  

### 1️⃣ **Video Upload Issues**  
- **Issue:** Uploaded video uses a `blob:` URL, but the frontend expects a direct file path.  
- **Fix:** Convert the video URL to a valid file path before passing it to the frontend.  

### 2️⃣ **GIF Generation Stalling**  
- **Issue:** GIF processing occasionally fails when using timestamps.  
- **Fix:** Ensure correct handling of timestamps and fix backend request format.  

### 3️⃣ **Progress Bar Inconsistencies**  
- **Issue:** The animated progress bar sometimes doesn’t update properly.  
- **Fix:** Adjust state updates in React to ensure smooth progress display.  

## ✅ Fixed Issues  

- **Backend not responding** → Resolved by checking API routes.  
- **Incorrect font selection for GIF captions** → Fixed by applying font styles dynamically.
